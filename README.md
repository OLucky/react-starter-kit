  - _/scss/_ - .scss files.
  - _/scripts/_ - .js files.
  - _/templates/_ - template files.
  	- _/pages/_ - main templates for pages. Automaticly picked up by HTML Webpack Plugin.

  - _/static/_ - various static files to be included in the project. 
  
Inner structure of _src_ subfolders may vary though files are prefered to be grouped by domain.
